### v2.0.0-alpha
In this version of **Project Iris** we have rebuilt the original source code in order to provide a friendly user interface.

- Resizable window
- Dark-Mode theme (more themes to be released in later versions)
- Basic input field for user to input their queries and commands
- Basic menu bar for navigation and quicktools [currently supports 4 config options]
